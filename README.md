# Timely
Timely is a Productivity Timer with Analytics for Users with an Account

Timely is self-hosted, but when I've shipped the first version I'll provide a link to try it out online

## Status
**In progress**
I'm currently developing the first version, after which I'll provide docker installation instructions and begin hosting on repl.it
