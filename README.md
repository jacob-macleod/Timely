# Timely
Timely is a Productivity Timer (with analytics for users with an account)

Timely is self-hosted, but when I've shipped the first version I'll provide a link to try it out online

## Status
**In progress**

I'm currently developing the first version, after which I'll provide docker installation instructions and begin hosting on repl.it

## Usage
I'll add commands to install from docker when I've made the first version, but for now you can clone from github to try it out. 

**IMPORTANT** - The encryption key for the login data is publically shown in `database.py`, so you should change it. However, even then the encryption isn't that good - it's only a Ceaser Cipher
